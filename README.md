# Linear-Regression-with-One-Variable-in-Machine-Learning

This project includes the code I wrote in Matlab to conduct linear regression with one variable. 

I first plotted the data to visualize the graph. I then computed the cost function J(theta) and used gradient descent to minimize the cost function J(theta). Last, I visualized the J(theta) after gradient descent to verify if it has reached to the optimal point.
